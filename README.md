An element is a substance that cannot be broken down into two or more simpler substances by any chemical method by the application of heat or light. For instance, on melting the piece of gold, it still melts and remains as the gold element. These substances are composed of a singular type of atoms, that is, they are monoatomic. Elements are considered to be the building blocks of matter. There are 118 elements that exist in total till now, 94 elements out of these occur in nature whereas the 24 left are prepared artificially.

Elements can occur in all three states in the matter, that is, solid, liquid or gaseous state. Elements are recognized using chemical symbols and formulae. Elements maintain their homogeneity. For instance, a piece of gold is made up of only gold atoms. Atom is the smallest unit forming elements. It dictates the properties of elements. Elements also possess sharp melting and boiling points.
